Hi, I’m Adams, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I have hands-on experience in machine learning workflows, mobile and web application development, Python scripting, and SQL. I enjoy building practical, user-focused software and improving systems through automation.
My background includes supporting enterprise applications in a higher-education IT environment, managing and querying databases, and working with modern AI/ML tools to solve real-world problems. I am committed to continuous learning and applying my programming skills to support software development initiatives.
