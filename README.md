Computer Science graduate from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) with hands-on experience in machine learning workflows, mobile and web application development, Python scripting and SQL. I enjoy building practical, user-focused software and improving systems through automation and intelligent design.
My background includes supporting enterprise applications in a higher-education IT environment, developing backend features, querying and managing databases, and working with modern AI/ML tools for real-world problem solving.
I am currently seeking entry-level software engineering or programmer roles where I can continue growing in backend development and AI-driven application development while contributing to reliable, scalable systems.
