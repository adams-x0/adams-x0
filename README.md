👋 Hi, I’m Adams
👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering, IoT, AI/ML and Research.
🌱 I’ve completed my Associate's degree in Computer Science at the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) and I transferred to the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) to complete my Bachelor's degree in the same field.
💞️ I'm currently an assistant programmer at CCBC's app development department.
